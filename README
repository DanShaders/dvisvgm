dvisvgm -- A DVI to SVG converter

DESCRIPTION

 dvisvgm is a utility for TeX/LaTeX users. It converts
 DVI files to the XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format.


DEPENDENCIES

 dvisvgm relies on the following free libraries:
   * FreeType 2 (http://www.freetype.org)
     This library is used to extract glyph outlines
     from PFB files.

   * kpathsea
     This library is part of the Web2C package and is
     usually installed in conjunction with a TeX distribution.
     kpathsea provides functions for searching files in the
     large texmf tree.

   * potracelib (http://potrace.sourceforge.net)
     Peter Selinger's bitmap tracing library is utilized to
     vectorize Metafont's bitmap output.

   * zlib (http://www.zlib.org)
     Compressed SVG files are produced by using functions
     of this library and the Gzstream wrapper classes
     (http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/compgeom/gzstream)
     which should be included with this package.


COMPILATION

 Quick installation info:
   * type "./configure"
   * type "make"
   * type "make install" as root

 For generic configuration instructions see the file INSTALL.

 The configure script should recognize all necessary parameters.
 If a library is installed but not detected, specify its location
 as commandline parameter of configure, e.g.
   ./configure --with-freetype=/usr/local/freetype
 (all available options can be displayed with ./configure --help)

 The tracer module calls Metafont in case of lacking TFM or PFB files
 via a system call. Please ensure that Metafont is installed and
 reachable over the search path.

 To build Windows binaries I recommend MinGW in conjunction
 with MSYS (http://www.mingw.org). If executed within MSYS
 the configure script assumes that you want to build dvisvgm
 for MikTeX. In this case the necessary import libraries for
 the MikTeX DLLs will be created and linked. If not already done,
 add the MikTeX bin directory to your search path, otherwise the
 required DLLs won't be found while running dvisvgm.

 If you don't like compiling the sources yourself, you can
 download precompiled executables for Windows and MikTeX
 from sourceforge.net instead (see below).


USAGE

 The user interface is very simple yet. Just specify the DVI
 file and the converter creates an SVG file with the same name
 but extension .svg. When choosing the -z option a compressed
 SVG file with extension .svgz will be written. The optional
 parameter specifies the compression level (valid values are
 1 to 9, default is 3). Larger values cause better compression
 results but take more computation time.

 Currently only a single page can be converted. If the -p option
 is omitted, the first page is choosen. Please consider that the
 parameter of option -p denotes the actual page count and not the
 number printed on that page. This is because the latter can be
 ambiguous (e.g. in cases where multiple dvi files have been merged).


 Usage: dvisvgm [OPTIONS] dvifile

  -h, --help             print help and exit
  -V, --version          print version and exit
  -b, --bbox=format      sets size/format of bounding box  (default=`dvi')
  -m, --mag=factor       magnification of Metafont output  (default=`4')
  -o, --output=filename  set name of output file
  -p, --page=number      choose page to convert  (default=`1')
  -s, --stdout           write SVG output to stdout
  -v, --verbosity=level  set verbosity level (0-7)  (default=`7')
  -z, --zip[=level]      create compressed SVG (.svgz) file  (default=`3')

 Option -b sets the bounding box of the generated graphic to the specified size/format. 
 The format argument is a case-insensitive string that denotes the paper size. Following 
 size names are supported:

 International DIN/ISO paper sizes:
   An, Bn, Cn, Dn, where n is a non-negative integer, e.g. A4 or a4 for 
   DIN/ISO A4 format (210mm × 297mm).

 North American paper sizes:
   invoice, executive, legal, letter, ledger

 Special bounding box sizes:
   dvi  - the page size stored in the DVI file will be used
   min  - the minimal bounding box will be computed and assigned
   none - no bounding box will be assigned

 The default page orientation for DIN/ISO and American paper sizes is portrait, 
 i.e. width < height. Appending -landscape or simply -l to the format string switches 
 to landscape mode (width > height). For symmetry reasons you can also explicitly add 
 -portrait or -p to indicate the default portrait format. Note that these suffixes
 are part of the size string and not separate options. Thus they must directly follow 
 the above mentioned size specifiers without additional blanks. Furthermore, the 
 orientation suffixes can't be used with dvi, min and none.

 This option only affects the bounding box and doesn't transform the page content. 
 Hence if you choose a landscape format the page won't be rotated.


 Option -m selects the magnification factor used when Metafont is called
 prior to trace a font's glyphs. The larger this value the better the
 tracing results. Nevertheless large magnification values can cause
 Metafont arithmetic errors due to number overflows. So use this
 option with care. The dafault setting usually produces nice results.


 Option -v controls the type of messages printed while a dvisvgm run:
    0 - no message output
    1 - informal output only
    2 - warning messages only
    4 - error messages only
 By adding these values you can combine the categories. Default is 7,
 i.e. all messages are printed.
