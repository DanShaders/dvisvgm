In order to build dvisvgm for MiKTeX with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 you
need to download the source code archives of the following libraries:

FreeType:   http://freetype.org
Potrace:    http://potrace.sourceforge.net
zlib:       http://zlib.net

Additionally, the MiKTeX SDK is required:
http://www.miktex.org/sdk

Unpack the MiKTeX SDK into the "vc" directory so that the new subfolder
miktex-2.9.4106-sdk is created there.

The contents of the library archives go into the corresponding subfolders
already present in the "vc" directory. Extract the archives and move the
contents of the versioned root folders, e.g. zlib-1.2.8, to the dedicated
subfolders of the "vc" directory.
For example, the contents of zlib-1.2.8 should be moved to dvisvgm\vc\zlib.
The versioned library folders are not required and can be deleted.

Now open the Visual Studio IDE, load dvisvgm.sln, and start the build process.

Alternatively, you can trigger the build process on the command-line with
  msbuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=<platform> dvisvgm.sln
where <platform> is either "win32" or "x64" for the 32 and 64bit binaries,
respectively.
